# 🧠 USDA SQL Analysis Project

This repository contains my final capstone project for the **"SQL for Data Science and Analytics"** course by the **University of California** on **Coursera**.  
The project uses **real USDA production data** to answer business-critical questions using **SQL**.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The project includes the following datasets:

| Table Name           | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `cheese_production`  | Cheese production by state and month/year        |
| `milk_production`    | Annual milk production by state                  |
| `coffee_production`  | Coffee production by year                        |
| `honey_production`   | Honey production by state and year               |
| `yogurt_production`  | Yogurt production by state and year              |
| `state_lookup`       | Mapping of State ANSI codes to state names       |

## 📌 Key Business Questions Solved

- ✅ Identify states with **cheese production > 100M lbs** in April 2023
- ✅ Calculate **total milk production** for the year 2023
- ✅ Determine **coffee production trends** over multiple years
- ✅ Find the **average honey production** for 2022
- ✅ Retrieve **yogurt production** for states that produced cheese in 2023
- ✅ Show **all states** (even with zero values) with their cheese production for April 2023

- Subqueries & Nested Filtering
- GROUP BY, HAVING, and Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG)
- Data Cleaning (using REPLACE to handle commas)
- Conditional Filtering (WHERE, IN, NOT IN)
- NULL and 0-value handling
